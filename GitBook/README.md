## Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the 4ID3 IoT Devices & Networks lab component! My name is Adam Sokacz and I am an Automation graduate from the class of 2023. I have a passion for software development and using software to solve real world challenges! Apart from that, I am an avid cyclist, I love biking and hiking the amazing trails around Hamilton and throughout the golden horseshoe.  I have had the extraordinary opportunity to be a part of the course revamp and restructure many of the lab experiments that you will be doing this semester.

For questions or technical support, you can contact me at&#x20;
